	<h3>Developed a Jupyter notebook to plan future vacation locations. Jupyter notebook requests weather data from the Google places API. Created a search engine to identify cities and the closest hotel that match weather data criteria (wind speed, cloudiness, maximum temperature, and humidity). Locations and hotels are then plotted on a map.</h3>
